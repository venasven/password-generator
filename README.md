# Password Generator

## Description

This password generator was created using Java Script. During this challange, I struggled with creating prompt windows that were responsive and understanding exactly how arrays are meant to be represented in the code itself. I found myself researching quite a bit extra, but ultimately I believe I have a better understanding of what was needed. 
This generator includes responsive prompts for each parameter selection while still guiding the user should they make an incorrect selection. The password lengths are customizable from 8 to 128 characters long and include special characters, numbers, upper case and lower case letters. I used if and while loops with in the code for each prompt and a for loop for the password generation itself.
